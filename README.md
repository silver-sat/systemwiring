System wiring diagram

This is a system wiring diagram for the Silversat Cubesat.

Because backplane signal names were not consistent between boards, a naming system was created with the following format:
(Local net name)_(Header Reference Designator)_(Header pin)

One of the key uses of this diagram is to verify signal crossing on each serial bus.
Another is to verify what bus is going to which board (it has been evolving over time)

Additional test headers were brought out for each.

The schematic for each board has been simplified to remove detail, except for external headers.  You can still look at each sheet.
It would be better to link these to actual design pages in the long run so that updates are captured automatically.
